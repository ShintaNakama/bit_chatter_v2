# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# message1 = Message.new(:id => 1, :name => 'shinta', :body => 'First Message')
# message1.created_at = Time.now
# message1.save
# message2 = Message.new(:name => 'miyamoto', :body => 'test !!!!')
# message2.created_at = Time.now
# message2.save
